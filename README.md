# Platformer
A C++ UNFINISHED platformer with SFML 2.6

In the video, I ended it with the fact that the project didn't work, but now booting it up a month later, it does!
Why? IDK! Sadly, the project remains unfinished forever.

Download the ZIP file and extract it to your project if you want the source code, and you can try to finish it if you like!
